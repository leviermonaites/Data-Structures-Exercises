Understand the problem:
	Restate the problem in my own words:
	So, given two arrays, evaluate whether the second array has all the numbers of the first array squared.
	
	What are the inputs?
	We can assume that we would have just two arrays with numbers.

	Do I have enough information?
	Yeah, it's really straightforward to understand.

	How should I label important pieces of data of my code?
	An object called valuesFrequency, to manage how many times a value appears in the arrays.
	
Concrete examples:
	same([1, 2, 3], [4, 1, 9]) // true
	same([1, 2, 3], [1, 9]) // false
	same([1, 2, 1], [4, 4, 1]) // false, must be the same frequency
