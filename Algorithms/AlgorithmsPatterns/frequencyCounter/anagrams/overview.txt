Understand the problem:
	Restate the problem in my own words:
	Given two strings, evaluate whether the two of them use the same letters and have the same length to be built. This concept has a technical name called anagram.

	What are the inputs that go into the problem?
	We can assume that they will always be single words without spaces, punctuations, periods and numbers.
	We can assume that we will deal with lowercase letters

	What are the outputs that should come from my solution?
	Boolean values

	Do I have enough information?
	Yes.

	How should I label important parts of the code?
	The first parameter will be str1 and the second str2
	An object called charFrequency to store how many times each char of the first parameter appears along the string.

	validAnagram('', '') // true
	validAnagram('aaz', 'zza') // false
	validAnagram('anagram', 'nagaram') // true
	validAnagram('rat', 'car') // false
	validAnagram('cinema', 'iceman') // true
