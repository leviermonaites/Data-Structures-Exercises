Understand the problem:
	Restate the problem in my own words:
	Create a function called sumZero which takes a stored array of integers, and evaluate whether there are two numbers that when they're added up, the result is 0.

	What are the inputs that go into my function:
	Just a sorted array of integers.	

	What are the outputs that should come from my solution:
	An array with two integers which once added up to one another, it results in 0. If there isn't such pair, return undefined.

	Do I have enough information?
	Yeah.

	How should I label important pieces of my code?
	Two pointers variables, one called i and the other called j, to iterate the array.
	
Concrete examples:
	sumZero([-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3]) // [-3, 3]
	sumZero([-2, 0, 1, 3]) // undefined
	sumZero([1, 2, 3]) // undefined
