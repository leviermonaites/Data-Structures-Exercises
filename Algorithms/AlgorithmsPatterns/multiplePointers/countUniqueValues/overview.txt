Understand the problem:
	Restate the problem in my own words.
	Count how many times an array contains idiosyncratic integers instead of repeated ones.

	What are the inputs that go into my function?
	A sorted array of integers.

	What are the outputs that should come from my solution?
	A number representing how many times were found unique integers.

	Do I have enough information?
	No

	How should I label important pieces of my code?
	Two variables called i and j to iterate over the array.
	One variable called counter to store how many times were found unique values.
	
Concrete examples:
	countUniqueValues([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2]) // 2
	countUniqueValues([1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 7, 7, 12, 12, 13]) // 7
	countUniqueValues([]) // 0
	countUniqueValues([-2, -1, -1, 0, 1]) // 4
