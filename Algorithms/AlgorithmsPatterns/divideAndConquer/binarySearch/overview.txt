Understand the problem:
	Restate the problem in my own words:
	Given a sorted array and a number, try to find the number in the sorted array without using linear search.
	
	What are the inputs that go into my function:
	A sorted array and a number to be searched for.

	What are the outputs that should come from my function:
	If the number is found within the array, we should return its index.
	If the number is not found, we should return -1.

	Do I have enough information?
	Yes.

	How should I label important pieces of my code?
	A variable called p to be some sort of a pivot that will have the value of the middle index of the array.
	

Concrete examples:
	search([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 4) // 3
	search([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 6) // 5
	search([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 11) // -1
