Understand the problem:
	Restate the problem in my words:
	Find the largest sequence resulting in the largest sum in an array of integers.
	The size of the sequence is defined by a parameter num

	What are the inputs that go into my function?
	Two parameters:
	An array of INTEGERS;
	One integer to determine the size of the sequence.

	What are the outputs that should come from my solution?
	An integer representing the largest possible sum found.

	Do I have enough information?
	Can I assume that the array is going to be always filled with integers?
	Yes. But maybe you'll find one empty array.

	Is there a minimum to the num parameter?
	0.

	If the num parameter is 0 or the array passed is empty, what should be the output?
	null
	
	What if the num parameter is greater than the length of the array?
	The output should be null as well.
	
	How should I label important pieces of my code?
	A variable called maxSum to store the current found largest sum.
	A variable called tempSum to compare to maxSum and evaluate which of them is greater.

	
Concrete examples:
	maxSubarraySum([1, 2, 5, 2, 8, 1, 5], 2) // 10
	maxSubarraySum([1, 2, 5, 2, 8, 1, 5], 4) // 17
	maxSubarraySum([4, 2, 1, 6], 1) // 6
	maxSubarraySum([4, 2, 1, 6, 2], 4) // 13
	maxSubarraySum([], 4) // null
