Understand the problem:
	Restate the problem in my own words:
	Given a number of arguments, evaluate whether there is one value appearing twice.

	What are the inputs that go into my function?
	Unlimited number of arguments

	What are the outputs that should come from my solution?
	A boolean value representing whether there was or not any duplicated value passed as argument.

	Do I have enough information?
	Yes.

	How should I label important pieces of my code?
	I should make use of an object called values to store how many times each value was passed.

Concrete examples:
	areThereDuplicates(1, 2, 3) // false
	areThereDuplicates(1, 2, 2) // true
	areThereDuplicates('a', 'b', 'c', 'a') // true
