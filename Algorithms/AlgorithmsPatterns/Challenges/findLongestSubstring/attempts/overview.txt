Understand the problem:
	Restate the problem in my own words:
	Given a string, find its largest no word repeating substring.

	What are the inputs that go into my function?
	Any type of string.

	What are the outputs that should come from my function?
	An integer representing the amount of individual characters.

	Do I have enough information?
	Is it possible that I'll come across with spaces in the given string?
	No

	What about case sensitivity?
	All letters will lowercase

	How should I label important pieces of my code?
	An object called charsObj to store whether a character has already appeared in the string.
	Create counter variable to store how many individual characters were found.

Concrete examples:
	findLongestSubstring('') // 0
	findLongestSubstring('rithmschool') // 7
	findLongestSubstring('thisisawesome') // 6
	findLongestSubstring('thecatinthehat') // 7
	findLongestSubstring('bbbbbb') // 1
	findLongestSubstring('longestsubstring') // 8
	findLongestSubstring('thisishowwedoit') // 6
