Understand the problem:
	Restate the problem in my own words:
	Given an array of integers and a target average, try to find two integers within the array which average is equal to the target average.

	What are the inputs that go into my function?
	An array of integers, and a number representing the target average.

	What are the outputs that should come from my solution?
	Boolean values representing whether there was or not a pair found.

	Do I have enough information?
	Yes

	How should I label each important piece of my code?
	Two variables one called start and the other called end
	The start variable should have its initial value set to 0 -> Representing the first index of the array
	The end variable should have its initial value set to arr.length - 1 -> Representing the last index of the array.

Concrete examples:
	averagePair([1, 2, 3], 2.5) // true
	averagePair([1, 3, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 19], 8]) // true
	averagePair([-1, 9, 3, 4, 5, 6], 4.1) // false
	averagePair([], 4) // false
