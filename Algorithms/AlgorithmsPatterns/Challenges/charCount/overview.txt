Understand the problem:
	Problem in my own words
	1 - For each character in a given string, keep track of how many times the character appears in the string.
	
	What are the inputs?
	2 - Inputs are going to be strings, but may be invalid inputs which you should treat.

	Which is the supposed output?
	3 - An object, which the keys contained within will be characters that appeared in the string.

	Do I have enough information to solve the problem?
	What about invalid data:
	Return an empty object.

	- What about special characters?
	No need to care about them.

	- What about differentiation between lowercased letters and uppercased ones?
	All of them should become lowercased in our returned object.

	Label for each important piece of data
	- a parameter named string
	- charObj for the object that we are going to manipulate
	- for loop with a simple let i, that iterates over the string.

	Input: "Hello my friend."
	Output: { h: 1, e: 2, l: 2, o: 1, m: 1, y: 1, f: 1, r: 1, i: 1, n: 1, d: 1 }
	
	Input: "Your code is $#2*124*("
	Output: { y: 1, o: 2, u: 1, r: 1, c: 1, d: 1, e: 1, i: 1, s: 1, 2: 2, 1: 1, 4: 1 }
