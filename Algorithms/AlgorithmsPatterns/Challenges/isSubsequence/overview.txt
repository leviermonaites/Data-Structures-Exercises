Understand the problem:
	Restate the problem in my own words:
	Evaluate whether a given string appears in some way in second given string.
	For example: isSubsequence("Car", "Cpap isn't rad") should return true

	What are the inputs that go into my function?
	Two strings

	What are the outputs that should come from my solution?
	Boolean values representing whether the first string is or not a subsequence of the second one.

	Do I have enough information?
	Yes

	How should I label important pieces of my code?
	Two variables called pointerOne and pointerTwo.
	pointerOne should be 0 at the very beginning -> Representing the first character of the first string
	pointerTwo should be also 0 but representing the second string.

Concrete examples:
	isSubsequence('hello', 'hello world'); // true
	isSubsequence('sing', 'string'); // true
	isSubsequence('abc', 'abracadabra'); // true
	isSubsequence('abc', 'acb'); // false (order matters)
